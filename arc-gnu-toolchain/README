This toolchain is build for /opt/arc/gnu on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

To install the toolchain, goto /opt/arc/gnu and do:

  $> sudo tar xvjf arc-gnu-toolchain-4.4.7.tar.bz2
  
When installation elsewhere is required, the next procedure should be executed:

    Fixing the RPATH of the binaries to be moved is the issue.
	There is a script fix-rpath.sh, which has to be run from the directory
	location where the toolchain has/is moved to.
	It will patch the RPATH.

    NOTE: that patchelf is not available as a standard Ubuntu download
	      (it is in Fedora), needs download from:

          http://hydra.nixos.org/release/patchelf/patchelf-0.6

    Select the 64-bit debian 5 version and install it with:

        $> sudo dpkg -i patchelf_0.6-1_amd64.deb

    Then cd to the tool chain directory and run the script

        $> cd <my toolchain directory location>/4.4.7
        $> sudo ./fix-rpath.sh
