This toolchain is prebuilt for installation in /opt/arc/gnu on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (x86-64).

When installing on Fedora, it is required to do the next;
 + download and installion (yum not supported) of the next package:
  cloog-ppl-0.15.7-2.fc14.x86_64.rpm  from:
  http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/17432438/dir/fedora_14/com/cloog-ppl-0.15.7-2.fc14.x86_64.rpm.html
  $> rpm -ql cloog-ppl
  $> ln -s libcloog.so.0.0.0 libcloog-ppl.so
 + the lib path needs to be extended:
  $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/arc/gnu/4.4.7/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/arc-linux-uclibc/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To install the toolchain, go to /opt/arc/gnu (or create these folders) and do:

  $> sudo tar xvjf arc-gnu-le-abi2-toolchain-4.4.7-x86-64.tar.bz2

It results in the folder /opt/arc/gnu/4.4.7 where in the "bin" folder the tools are located.
  
When the prebuilt toolchain needs to be installed or relocated to another directory,
the following procedure should be executed to fix the RPATH of the binaries being relocated:
	
	The provided fix-rpath.sh script needs to be run from the directory
	location where the toolchain has been installed/relocated. 
	The script will patch the RPATH appropriately.

    NOTE: that patchelf is not available as a standard Ubuntu download
    (it is in Fedora), it can be downloaded from:

          http://hydra.nixos.org/release/patchelf/patchelf-0.6

    Select the 64-bit debian 5 version and install it with the following command:

        $> sudo dpkg -i patchelf_0.6-1_amd64.deb

    Then cd to the toolchain directory and run the script

        $> cd <my toolchain directory location>/4.4.7
        $> sudo ./fix-rpath.sh
